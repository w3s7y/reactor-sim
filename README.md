# reactor-sim

My personal Rust learning project. 

Simulation game of a PWR.  Manage temperature and pressure in the system via cli. 

## Development notes / WIP

### First things first

* Do some very simple things to get my head around Rust modules and their visibility.
* Model a solid steel cylinder (the reactor housing) that has a volume and a pressure

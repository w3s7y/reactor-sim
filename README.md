My personal Rust learning project. 

Simulation game of a PWR.  Manage temperature and pressure in the system via a basic cli.

Real-time sim with a command cli, so commands entered interrupt the main thread 


## Development notes / WIP

### First things first

* Do some very simple things to get my head around Rust modules and their visibility.
* Model a solid steel cylinder (the reactor housing) that has a volume and a pressure
